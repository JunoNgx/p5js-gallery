# P5JS text slide

A simple creative coding project driven by motion graphic and typography.
## Description

The project is made with [p5js](https://p5js.org/), a Javascript framework made for creative coding. A string is text is displayed, but hidden by its colour, which coincides with the background color. The content of the string is slowly revealed by a series of moving parallelograms as negative space.

The project can be viewed via [GitHub Page](https://junongx.github.io/p5js-text-slide/). 

## Branches

This project has also been ported to vanilla Javascript using only HTML5 canvas API on the branch `vanilla-js`. A variant of this is deployed on my portfolio website.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
