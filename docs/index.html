        <p>Welcome to my gallery of creative coding, where practicalities, pragmatism, and functions are second-class citizens. Think of an even more frivolous version of videogame developement.</p>
        <p>Having been a patron of the art, I have always been looking for new ways to express myself creatively, and creative coding is the perfect canvas for it (pun intended).</p>
        <p>Most of my works are created with p5js, though a number of them use plain and vanilla canvas API for better embeddability. This entire project is also open source (which can be found on my GitHub profile).</p>
        <p>Alternatively, I also have an OpenProcessing.org profile, which helps me engage with the community.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, enjoy your stay.</p>
